Announcing our [second post under the Dynamic/Unknown participation model](https://blog.chain.link/instant-finality-in-byzantine-atomic-broadcast-under-unknown-dynamic-participation/),
where we expand our previous
[one-shot, binary solution](https://blog.chain.link/instant-finality-in-byzantine-generals-with-unknown-and-dynamic-participation/) 
to full **Byzantine atomic broadcast**. 
Key properties of the solution remain, including small constant (3-round) expected latency to finality and allowing an adversary to fluctuate Byzantine parties from round to round provided that two-thirds of the active participants are honest.
