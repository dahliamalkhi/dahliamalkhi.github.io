# Validated, Provable, Consistent Broadcast (Verfiable-CBC): The Core Sub-Protocol of HotStuff 

HotStuff, introduced by Yin, Malkhi et al. in [[@Yin2019HotStuffBC]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197644531),
provides the first practical solution to the
[[SMR problem]](https://malkhi.com/posts/2025/01/models/)
with optimal communication complexity $O(n + t \cdot n)$, against $t$ actual cascading faults. 

This post describes the key building block employed in HotStuff, a *Validated, Provable, Consistent Broadcast* ("Verifiable CBC"), depicted in Figure 1 below. 
The original [HotStuff: Three-Chain Rules](https://malkhi.com/posts/2019/08/hotstuff-three-chain-rules/) requires chaining three phases of Verfiable CBC as a core sub-protocol operated by each leader.

A single phase of the Verfiable CBC is a twist on a common building block, Consistent
Broadcast ("CBC")[^1]. Like the CBC primitive, Verfiable CBC guarantees:

(i) Agreement. 
: All honest parties VPCBC-deliver the same message by a sender, if any.

(ii) Non-triviality.
: If a sender is honest, then eventually all honest
parties VPCBC-deliver a message from it.

Cachin et al. added in [[@Cachin2001SecureAE]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18716687) on top of CBC two additional properties (jointly referred to as Verifiability):

(iii) External Validity. 
: A broadcast message is accepted by parties if it
    satisfies a customizable application--specific validity condition,
    which they can verify at runtime.

(iv) Provability. 
: If an honest party VPCBC-delivers a broadcast message, it can
    prove to other parties that it correctly delivered it.

## 1-Phase Verfiable CBC

A single phase of Verfiable CBC revolves around a CBC protocol introduced by Reiter
in [[@Reiter1994SecureAP]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1990309). Borrowing Reiter's method, we can solve 1-phase Verfiable CBC as depicted in Figure 1 above at
the top-left, and represented by a QC icon at the top-right.
The protocol has linear Communication complexity, 
$O(n)$.
A pseudo-code of Verfiable CBC with an optional number of phases is listed below in Algorithm 1.

Specifically, in 1-phase , a sender invokes VPCBC-send($m$, $V$) by broadcasting $m$ and
the validity condition $V()$ to all validators. Each validator verifies
the validity of the message according to the customizable predicate
$V()$. If $m$ passes the verification, the validator sends back to the
sender a threshold-signed *vote* on $m$. The sender waits to collect a
Byzantine quorum consisting of $2f+1$ votes, and then aggregates the
signature shares into a single signature, referred to as a Quorum
Certificate denoted $QC(m)$. Finally, the sender broadcasts the $QC(m)$
to all validators and they VPCBC-deliver it.

---

- For sender $s$ to VPCBC-send($m, V$), send($m, V$) to all nodes.

- **Upon** first message $(x, V)$ received by node $j$,
 	if  $V(x)$ send TE.Share-Sign($j, V, x$) to $s$.

- **Upon** $2f+1$ valid TE shares $\sigma_i(x)$ received by sender $s$, 
 	set $QC(x) \gets$ TE.Sign($x, \sigma_1, ..., \sigma_{2f+1}$) and
 	send $QC(x)$ to all nodes.

- **Upon** a valid $QC(y)$ received by node $j$,
  - in 1-phase protocol, VPCBC-deliver($y$).
  - in 2-phase protocol, set $lock \gets QC(y)$ and send TE.Share-Sign($j, QC(y)$) to $s$
  - in 3-phase protocol, set $key \gets QC(y)$ and send TE.Share-Sign($j, QC(y)$) to $s$

- **Upon** a valid $QC(QC(y))$ received by node $j$

  - in 2-phase protocol, VPCBC-deliver($y$) 
  - in 3-phase protocol, $lock \gets QC(y)$ and send TE.Share-Sign($j, QC(QC(y))$) to $s$

- **Upon** a valid $QC(QC(QC(y)))$ received by node $j$

  - in 3-phase protocol, VPCBC-deliver($y$)

**Algorithm 1.** 1-phase, 2-phase, 3-phase Verfiable CBC.

## 2-Phase  Verfiable CBC

In 2-phase Verfiable CBC, another round of validator voting is added. Each validator
sends back to the sender a threshold-signed vote on $QC(m)$. Note that
the validity predicate is not reinstanted in this case (except for standard
format and signature verification, which is omitted), because the QC
from the first phase guarantees it is valid.

The sender collects and aggregates the votes and broadcasts $QC(QC(m))$.
2-phase is depicted in Figure 1 above (middle).

Importantly, the two phases are interpreted as *lock* and *commit*: We
say that a validator *commits* $m$ if it VPCBC-delivers $m$, and *locks* on
$m$ if it votes on $QC(m)$. 2-phase provides the following *lock-commit*
guarantee:

Commit-Lock

:   if any validator commits $m$, then $2f+1$ validators are *locked* on
    $m$.

## 3-Phase  Verfiable CBC

3-Phase Verfiable CBC adds another identical phase and provides a stronger guarantee than
lock-commit, referred to as *key-lock-commit*. We now say that a validator
*locks* on $m$ if it votes on $QC(QC(m))$, and holds a *key* on $m$ if
it votes on $QC(m)$. 3-phase provides the following guarantees:

Commit-Lock

:   if any validator commits $m$, then $2f+1$ validators are *locked* on
    $m$.

Handover Responsiveness

:   if any validator is locked on $m$, then $2f+1$ validators hold a
    *key* on $m$.

3-phase Verfiable CBC is depicted in Figure 1 (bottom left) and a QC iconic representation
(bottom right).

[^1]: The literature also refers to CBC as *secure broadcast*.
