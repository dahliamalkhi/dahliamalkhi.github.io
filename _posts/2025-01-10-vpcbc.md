# VPCBC: The Core Sub-Protocol of HotStuff 

HotStuff, introduced by Yin, Malkhi et al. in [[@Yin2019HotStuffBC]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:197644531),
provides the first practical solution to the
[[SMR problem]](https://malkhi.com/posts/2025/01/models/)
with optimal communication complexity $O(n + t \cdot n)$, against $t$ actual cascading faults. 

This post describes the key building block employed in HotStuff, a *Verifiable, Provable Consistent Broadcast* ("VPCBC"), depicted in Figure-1 below. HotStuff achieves optimality by chaining three phases of VPCBC as a core sub-protocol operated by each leader.

A single phase of the VPCBC is a twist on a common building block, Consistent
Broadcast ("CBC")[^1]. Like the CBC primitive, VPCBC guarantees:

(i) Agreement. 
: All honest parties VPCBC-deliver the same message by a sender, if any.

(ii) Non-triviality.
: If a sender is honest, then eventually all honest
parties VPCBC-deliver a message from it.

Cachin et al. added in [[@Cachin2001SecureAE]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18716687) two additional properties (jointly referred to as Verifiability):

(iii) External Validity. 
: A broadcast message is accepted by parties if it
    satisfies a customizable application--specific validity condition,
    which they can verify at runtime.

(iv) Provability. 
: If an honest party VPCBC-delivers a broadcast message, it can
    prove to other parties that it correctly delivered it.

## 1-Phase VPCBC

A single phase of VPCBC revolves around a CBC protocol introduced by Reiter
in [[@Reiter1994SecureAP]](https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:1990309). Borrowing Reiter's method, we can solve 1-phase VPCBC as depicted in Figure 1 above at
the top-left, and represented by a QC icon at the top-right.
A pseudo-code of the full VPCBC
solution is listed below in Algorithm 1.

Specifically, in 1-phase , a sender invokes VPCBC-send($m$, $V$) by broadcasting $m$ and
the validity condition $V()$ to all validators. Each validator verifies
the validity of the message according to the customizable predicate
$V()$. If $m$ passes the verification, the validator sends back to the
sender a threshold-signed *vote* on $m$. The sender waits to collect a
Byzantine quorum consisting of $2f+1$ votes, and then aggregates the
signature shares into a single signature, referred to as a Quorum
Certificate denoted $QC(m)$. Finally, the sender broadcasts the $QC(m)$
to all validators and they VPCBC-deliver it.

**Algorithm 1.** 1-phase, 2-phase, 3-phase VPCBC.

## 2-Phase  VPCBC

In 2-phase VPCBC, another round of validator voting is added. Each validator
sends back to the sender a threshold-signed vote on $QC(m)$. Note that
the validity predicate is not reinstanted in this case (except for standard
format and signature verification, which is omitted), because the QC
from the first phase guarantees it is valid.

The sender collects and aggregates the votes and broadcasts $QC(QC(m))$.
2-phase is depicted in Figure 1 above (middle).

Importantly, the two phases are interpreted as *lock* and *commit*: We
say that a validator *commits* $m$ if it VPCBC-delivers $m$, and *locks* on
$m$ if it votes on $QC(m)$. 2-phase provides the following *lock-commit*
guarantee:

Commit-Lock

:   if any validator commits $m$, then $2f+1$ validators are *locked* on
    $m$.

## 3-Phase  VPCBC

3-Phase VPCBC adds another identical phase and provides a stronger guarantee than
lock-commit, referred to as *key-lock-commit*. We now say that a validator
*locks* on $m$ if it votes on $QC(QC(m))$, and holds a *key* on $m$ if
it votes on $QC(m)$. 3-phase provides the following guarantees:

Commit-Lock

:   if any validator commits $m$, then $2f+1$ validators are *locked* on
    $m$.

Failover Responsiveness

:   if any validator is locked on $m$, then $2f+1$ validators hold a
    *key* on $m$.

3-phase VPCBC is depicted in Figure 1 (bottom left) and a QC iconic representation
(bottom right)].
