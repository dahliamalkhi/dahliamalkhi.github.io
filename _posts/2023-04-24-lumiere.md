excerpt: BFT consensus that achieves optimal worst-case communication complexity (quadratic) with constant expected latency

🙇 Two recent BFT breakthrough solutions in the partial synchrony model, [Lewis-Pye](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01107.pdf)/[RareSync](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09262.pdf), achieve communication-optimality.

😩 However, they suffer expected 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 each time a Byzantine leader is encountered.

💡 **Lumiere** retains communication optimality, while simultaneously having constant latency when a bad leader is encountered.
