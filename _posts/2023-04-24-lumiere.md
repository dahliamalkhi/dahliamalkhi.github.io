(NEW) Lumiere whitepaper is on the ArXiv: [[_Lumiere: Making Optimal BFT for Partial Synchrony Practical_]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08091). With Andrew Lewis-Pye, Oded Naor and Kartik Nayak.

A [previous post](https://malkhi.com/posts/2022/11/pacemakers/) on View Synchronization in BFT Consensus surfaces the following conundrum in state-of-art solutions:

* ðŸ™‡ Two recent breakthrough BFT solutions in the partial synchrony model, [Lewis-Pye](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.01107.pdf)/[RareSync](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09262.pdf), achieve communication-optimality.

* ðŸ˜© However, they suffer expected **linear latency** each time a Byzantine leader is encountered.

ðŸ’¡ In the post below, we introduce **Lumiere**, a BFT solution in the partial synchrony model that retains communication optimality, while simultaneously having constant latency when a bad leader is encountered.
