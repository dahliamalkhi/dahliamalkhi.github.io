🥇 Our recent work "HotStuff-1: Linear Consensus with One-Phase Speculation" [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04728]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04728) (https://lnkd.in/gcBsHshF) reduces latency:

🥈 by two network-hops over [[HotStuff-2]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/397.pdf), 
🆒 thus, by four network-hops over [[HotStuff]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069), 
🏆 while maintaining linear communication complexity against faults. 

HotStuff-1 achieves latency reduction by sending clients early responses speculatively, after one phase of the protocol. Unlike previous speculation regimes, the fast path of HotStuff-1 is fault-tolerant and does not rely on optimism.

Additionally, HotStuff-1 incorporates an incentive-compatible leader rotation regime that motivates leaders to commit consensus decisions promptly.
