Revisiting HotStuff with Kartk Nayak, we observe that two phases are enough after all to achieve all the desirable properties of HotStuff, namely: 
Optimal (quadratic) worst-case communication against a cascade of failures, optimistically linear communication, a two-phase commit regime within a view, and optimistic responsiveness.

In a future post, I'll try to explain why we missed it until now.
