In our [post on blog.chain.link](https://blog.chain.link/instant-finality-in-byzantine-generals-with-unknown-and-dynamic-participation/),
we present a remarkably simple solution for the Byzantine Generals problem with deterministic and unconditional Safety guarantees in a setting that has Unknown and Dynamic Participation, but without the energy waste of proof-of-work and or the long latency of longest chain protocols. With this, we remove the biggest obstacles of Nakamoto Consensus, which are probabilistic finality, high latency, and energy waste of proof-of-work, while retaining key tenets of the permissionless model.
