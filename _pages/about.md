I am a lead researcher at Facebook/Novi and the lead maintainer of the Libra project.

I have applied and foundational research interest in broad aspects of reliability and security of distributed systems. For over two decades, I participated in driving innovation in tech, notably:  co-inventor of HotStuff, co-founder and technical lead of VMware blockchain, co-inventor of Flexible Paxos, the technology behind Log Device, creator and tech lead of CorfuDB, a database-less database driving VMwareâ€™s NSX-T distributed control plane (see Corfu github repo), and co-inventor of the FairPlay project.

I joined Facebook/Novi in June 2019 as a research lead. In 2014, after the closing of the Microsoft Research Silicon Valley lab, I co-founded VMware Research and became a Principal Researcher at VMware until June 2019. From 2004-2014, I was a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, Silicon Valley. From 1999-2007, I served as tenured associate professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. From 1995-1999, I was a senior researcher at AT&T Labs, NJ.
