| **Research Advances in Scaling BFT Consensus** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _This talk gives a glimple onto a decade of innovation in scaling BFT Consensus which has been sparked by blockchains. Solutions to open problems emerged under three fault models, synchronous, asynchronous, and partially synchronous, all of which harnerss insights from the blockchain arena that led to new approaches._ | [[Financial Crypto 2024]](https://fc24.ifca.ai/program.html) | |
| **Unexpected Lessons from Production Systems Impacting the Foundations of Distributed Computing** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _This talk is a spin on the tech-transfer stories talk (below), in which I describe insights from distributed systems I worked on that led to breaking myths and grounds in distributed computing._ | [[NorCalDB Day 2023]](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/norcaldb-2023/) | |
| **Tech Transfer Stories and Takeaways** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _I spoke at various occassions about my experience driving basic research to production. The stories I share are all in the distributed computing arena. Yet, I hope that the take-aways from the experience of building foundations for these systems may be of interest and value to everyone, no matter the discipline._ | [[Brown 2023]](https://events.brown.edu/event/252258-dahlia-malkhi-research-flywheel-from-basic), [[Duke 2023]](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/events/71320), UCSB 2023, [[ICDCS keynote 2021]](https://icdcs2021.us/keynotes.html), [[Cornell 2021]](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/content/tech-transfer-stories-and-takeaways), [[DISC keynote 2021]](http://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2021/program/) |  [[üé•]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RRUQHymcJA) | 
| **Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Protection on a DAG** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _Many cryptocurrency platforms are vulnerable to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks, where a malicious consensus leader can inject transactions or change the order of user transactions to maximize its profit. This joint work with Pawel Szalachowski introduces [Fino](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00940), an efficient method to implement an approach known as ‚ÄúBlind Order-Fairness‚Äù, which enables certain MEV protection to services that subscribe to it._ | [[Science and Engineering of Consensus 2022]](https://tselab.stanford.edu/workshop-sbc22/)  | [[üé•]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WLoJRrnTsA&list=PL4XSNxeZhdqBBgqqokIdK4PcyPSl6t0rQ&index=6) |

**Blockchains in the Lens of BFT and HotStuff** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _In this series of talks, I introduced classical BFT foundations for blockchains which were gradually developed.  They followed several blogposts I made, including [[Blockchain/BFT]](https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2017/10/bft-blockchain/) [[The BFT Lens: HotStuff and Casper]](https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2018/03/bft-lens-casper/) [[The BFT Lens: Tendermint]](https://dahliamalkhi.github.io/posts/2018/04/BFT-lens-tndrmnt/), a [[BEATCS fall 2017 tutorial]](http://bulletin.eatcs.org/index.php/beatcs/article/view/506),¬† and culminating with the introduction of the HotStuff algorithm [[HotStuff-PODC2019]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05069)._ | [[Northeastern 2019]](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/event/distinguished-speaker-blockchains-in-the-lens-of-bft/), [[Swiss Blockchain Winter School 2019]](https://blockchainschool.epfl.ch/), [[JHU 2018]](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/news-events/gerald-m-masson-distinguished-lecture-series/), [[Usenix ATC '18]](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc18/presentation/malkhi), [[BITCOIN '18]](https://fc18.ifca.ai/bitcoin/index.html), [[Tsinghua-Cornell Blockchain Winter School 2017]](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/show-6611-1.html) |

|**Recent Advances in Consensus Research from Chainlink Labs** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; üí°üí° _This presentation describes two recent advances in BFT Consensus research, HotStuff-2 and BBCA-Chain, and the road that led to them._<br> | [[SmartCon23]](https://smartcon.chain.link/) | [[üé•]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZjfYRH4fVM) | 
|**Privacy-Preserving Oracles with DECO** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; üòØ _Imagine that users can bring claims about themselves into smart contracts with complete privacy:  "I am a person" (but not private information about me); "I live in the US" (but not my address); "my combined bank accounts balance is above a threshold" (but not my balances); and more._<br> &emsp;&emsp; ü§î _In this presentation at SmartCon 2022, we explain how DECO enables the unlocking of user information from current web 2.0 servers into Web 3.0; we describe the application of academic research to allow smart contracts to serve even more powerful use cases in a truly privacy-preserving manner; and we give a glimpse into real-world use cases._ | [[SmartCon22]](https://smartcon.chain.link/) | [[üé•]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJqZQ2_VBzo) | 
| **Connecting Blockchains and the World** <br><br> &emsp;&emsp; _What would it take for blockchains to enable people and businesses everywhere better, trusted and innovative financial foundations?  In the first part of the presentation, I briefly recall the Diem story, June 2018-January 2022. I joined the Diem project (it was named Libra back then) in 2019 as CTO and stayed until its closing. I explain the stablecoin structure Diem built over a purpose-built blockchain.  In the second part, I switch gears and talk about my current role as chief research officer at Chainlink Labs. Chainlink enables smart contracts to interact with the real world and to reduce trust in centralized intermediaries. I provide a glimpse into Chainlink Labs technology and a research outlook._ | [[Berkeley 2022]](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/events/), [[ICL 2022]](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/seminars), [ETH and EPFL 2022] | |
