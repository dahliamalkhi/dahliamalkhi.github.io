**Privacy-Preserving Oracles with DECO**.<br>
[[SmartCon22]](https://smartcon.chain.link/)
[[ðŸŽ¥]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJqZQ2_VBzo)

&emsp;&emsp; ðŸ˜¯ _Imagine that users can bring claims about themselves into smart contracts with complete privacy:  "I am a person" (but not private information about me); "I live in the US" (but not my address); "my combined bank accounts balance is above a threshold" (but not my balances); and more._<br>
&emsp;&emsp; ðŸ¤” _In this presentation at SmartCon 2022, we explain how DECO enables the unlocking of user information from current web 2.0 servers into Web 3.0; we describe the application of academic research to allow smart contracts to serve even more powerful use cases in a truly privacy-preserving manner; and we give a glimpse into real-world use cases._

*Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Protection on a DAG**.<br>

**Connecting Blockchains and the World**.<br>
[[UC Berkeley RISE/Sky seminar, summer 2022, invited speaker]](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/events/)<br>
 [[Imperial College London LSDS seminar, summer 2022, invited speaker]](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/seminars)<br>
 [ETH and EPFL, summer 2022]


&emsp;&emsp; _What would it take for blockchains to enable people and businesses everywhere better, trusted and innovative financial foundations?
In the first part of the presentation, I briefly recall the Diem story, June 2018-January 2022. I joined the Diem project (it was named Libra back then) in 2019 as CTO and stayed until its closing. I explain the stablecoin structure Diem built over a purpose-built blockchain.
In the second part, I switch gears and talk about my current role as chief research officer at Chainlink Labs. Chainlink enables smart contracts to interact with the real world and to reduce trust in centralized intermediaries. I provide a glimpse into Chainlink Labs technology and a research outlook._

**Tech Transfer Stories and Takeaways**. <br>
[[IEEE TCDP Outstanding Technical Achievement Award keynote at ICDCS 2021]](https://icdcs2021.us/keynotes.html) <br>
[[Cornell CS colloqium 2021 invited speaker]](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/content/tech-transfer-stories-and-takeaways) <br>
[[DISC 2021 keynote]](http://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2021/program/) [[ðŸŽ¥]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RRUQHymcJA)

&emsp;&emsp; _In this talk, I share impressions from several industrial research project experiences that reached
production and became part of successful products. I will go through four stories of how these
systems transpired and their journey to impact. All of the stories are in the distributed computing
arena, and more specifically, they revolve around the state-machine-replication paradigm. Yet, I
hope that the take-aways from the experience of building foundations for these systems may be of
interest and value to everyone, no matter the discipline._

**Flexible BFT and New Approaches in Byzantine Fault Tolerance**.<br>
[[Chicago booth Cryptocurrencies and Blockchains Conference, 2019, invited speaker]](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/event/cryptocurrencies-and-blockchains-conference/)<br>
[[Richard M. Karp Distinguished Lecture 2019]](https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-3)<br>
[[CES 2019, invited speaker]](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/)<br>
[[BC '19, invited speaker]](https://crypto.iacr.org/2019/affevents/blockchain/page.html)<br>
[[Tokenomics 2019, keynote]](http://tokenomics2019.org/infoattendees/invitedspeakers)<br>
[[she256 conference 2019, invited speaker]](https://www.recolor.io/) ,Â [[ðŸŽ¥]](https://youtu.be/4np_2K8WNPU?t=4297)

&emsp;&emsp; _In this presentation, I introduce the 
[Flexible BFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10067)
approach, a joint work with Kartik Nayak and Ling Ren.
Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols designed for building replicated services collapse
if deployed under settings that differ from the fault model they are designed for.
Flexible BFT is a new approach for BFT consensus solution design revolving around
two pillars. First, flexible BFT introduces a new fault model that allows
resilience to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault model.
Second, Flexible BFT separates between the fault model and the solution,
supporting in the same protocol synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well as varying resilience thresholds._
